README - pyLRp python LR(1) parser generator

Author: Sebastian Riese <sebastian.riese.mail@web.de>

The sample files show how to use the parser generator. But are out of
date at the moment. More documentation will follow. The parser
generator is written in python3, but it can generate both python2 and
python3 parsers.

The generated parsers are standalone modules.

Usage: pyLRp.py [options] INFILE

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OFILE, --output-file=OFILE
                        Set the output file to OFILE
  -l, --line-tracking   Enable line tracking in the generated parser
  -L, --lalr            Generate a LALR(1) parser instead of a LR(1) parser
  -d, --debug           Print debug information to stdout
  -D, --not-deduplicate
                        Write out the tables entirely as one big literal
  -f, --fast            Fast run: generates larger and possibly slower
                        parsers, but takes less time
  -T, --trace           Generate a parser that prints out a trace of its state
  -3, --python3         Generate python3 compatible parser
  -2, --python2         Generate python2 compatible parser
