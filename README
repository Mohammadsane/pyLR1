README - pyLRp python LR(1) parser generator

Author: Sebastian Riese <sebastian.riese.mail@web.de>

The sample files show how to use the parser generator. But are out of
date at the moment. More documentation will follow. The parser
generator is written in python3, but it can generate both python2 and
python3 parsers.

The generated parsers are standalone modules.

usage: pyLRp.py [-h] [-o OFILE] [-l] [-L] [-g] [--print-lextable] [-D] [-d]
                [-f] [-q] [-T] [-3 | -2]
                infile

A pure python LALR(1)/LR(1) parser generator and lexer generator.

positional arguments:
  infile                The parser specification to process

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OFILE, --output-file OFILE
                        Set the output file to OFILE [default: derived from
                        infile]
  -l, --line-tracking   Enable line tracking in the generated parser
  -L, --lalr            Generate a LALR(1) parser instead of a LR(1) parser
  -g, --print-graph     Print the LR state graph to stdout
  --print-lextable      Print the lextables to stdout
  -D, --not-deduplicate
                        Compress tables by reusing identical lines
  -d, --debug           Write debug information to the generated file
  -f, --fast            Fast run: generates larger and possibly slower
                        parsers, but takes less time
  -q, --quiet           Print less info
  -T, --trace           Generate a parser that prints out a trace of its state
  -3, --python3         Generate python3 compatible parser [default]
  -2, --python2         Generate python2 compatible parser
